    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The goal of this project is to determine if a job posting will offer a high or low salary based on its i) title; ii) company; and iii) job summary. The following steps are required to attain said goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Acquisition\n",
    "Data will be acquired by scraping information from the job aggregator site, Indeed.com. Job postings for the following roles were scraped:\n",
    "* Data Scientist\n",
    "* Data Analyst\n",
    "* Data Engineer\n",
    "* Business Intelligence\n",
    "* Research Analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of data scraping, there could be multiple instances of the same job posting - they will be removed. As a result, 3089 job postings remain, out of which only 152 contains salary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data Cleaning\n",
    "The process of data cleaning is to ensure that the data is presented in a consistent format, suitable for processing, analysis, and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-based data is cleaned through the removal of special characters, this will help during Natural Language Processing (NLP) which will be explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most salary data are presented in a range (e.g. 5,000 - 7,000 a month), and sometimes in different time period (e.g. 80,000 - 90,000 a year). In cleaning them, the data is converted to its average, by month.\n",
    "\n",
    "A job posting that offers high salary is defined when its average salary is greater than or equals to the median salary of 4,500 a month. Conversely, a job posting that offers low salary is defined when its average salary is lower than 4,500 a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "NLP is used that will, based on the text-based data presented, help predict if a job posting will be offering a high or low salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of NLP, terms that are most commonly found in job postings offering high salary & low salary is found. These terms will help in distinguishing between high & low salary. Good terms are defined as terms that appear 2.5x more in job postings that offer high salary than its low salary counterparts. Vice versa for bad terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Feature Engineering\n",
    "Based on the insights gleaned from the previous step, the data is reconfigured to binary features:\n",
    "* 1. Good_title: Does job title include the term \"sales\" or \"executive\"?\n",
    "* 2. Bad_title: Does job title include the terms \"data\", \"engineer\", \"software\", etc.?\n",
    "* 3. Good_company: Does company include the term \"services\" or \"group\"?\n",
    "* 4. Bad_company: Does company include the term \"asia\" or \"rakuten\"?\n",
    "* 5. Good_summary: Does job summary include the term \"sales\", \"market\", or \"support\"?\n",
    "* 6. Bad_summary: Does job summary include the term \"develop\", \"design\", \"solutions\", etc.?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Modeling and Conclusion\n",
    "The Logistic Regression model is used and it is 61% accurate in predicting if job posting offers a high or low salary. After applying the model to job postings without salary information, 1515 jobs(52 percent) were predicted to offer salaries above the median salary of $4,500 while the remaining 1422 jobs(48 percent) were predicted to offer salaries below the median salary.\n"
